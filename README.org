#+TITLE: OpamPack

OpamPack is a shell script that creates a ~tar.gz~ file containing all
the dependencies of a project, enabling the installation of a minimal
OCaml environment on a machine that doesn't have access to the internet.

Notes describing in detail what it does internally are available [[Notes.org][here]]

* Example

  On the machine connected to the internet, run:

  #+begin_src bash
./OpamPack.sh ocaml.4.11.2 ocamlbuild cryptokit zmq sexplib ppx_sexp_conv ppx_deriving getopt
  #+end_src

  Don't forget to include the =ocaml= package with the version of the
  compiler you want.

  In the =_build= directory, you will find a file named
  =opampack.tar.gz= containing all you need to install OPAM, OCaml and
  the dependencies you specified in the command line without any
  network access.

  Copy the =opampack.tar.gz= file to the machine that doesn't have
  internet access, and extract the file:

  #+begin_src 
tar -zxvf opampack.tar.gz
  #+end_src

  And run the install script in the opampack directory:

  #+begin_src 
cd opampack
./install.sh
  #+end_src

  Before using OCaml, you will need to execute:

  #+begin_src bash :tangle no
export OPAMROOT=/path/to/opampack/opamroot
eval $(/path/to/opampack/opam env --root=$OPAMROOT)
  #+end_src
